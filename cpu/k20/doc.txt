 *
 * @note This implementation currently only supports the k20_50 subfamily
 *       without FPU and a max frequency of 50 Mhz. The newer K20 devices with
 *       higher frequencies can probably be added easily. In theory you just
 *       need to add the device serial numbers to k20_family.h and define the
 *       variables configured there.
 *       This implementation also lacks configuration options for external
 *       clocks, see cpu.c for details.
