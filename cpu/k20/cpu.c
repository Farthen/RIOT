/**
 * @brief Configure the controllers clock system
 *
 * @note This currently only supports a fixed 48 Mhz internal clock source.
 *       This should at least have the option to support an external
 *       reference clock. As one wasn't available on the testing hardware this
 *       isn't implemented yet.
 *
 * "In FBI and FEI modes, setting C4[DMX32] bit is not recommended. If the
 * internal reference is trimmed to a frequency above 32.768 kHz, the
 * greater FLL multiplication factor could potentially push the
 * microcontroller system clock out of specification and damage the part."
 *
 * You have the option to do this even though it is kind of unsafe. This
 * relies on the internal clock being somewhat accurately trimmed. It is
 * supposed to be factory-trimmed to 32.768 kHz but if you want to be extra
 * careful measure it with your hardware yourself and apply trimming values
 * as necessary.
 *
 * If trimmed incorrectly this MAY push the clock up to a value of 39.0625 kHz.
 * For the k20_50 that was used as testing device for this port this would mean
 * about 57.18 Mhz with the 48 Mhz setting in the most extreme case when the
 * internal clock is the fastest possible within the specification AND trimmed
 * completely incorrectly to be even faster.
 *
 * If you want to set the FLL factor to the potentially unsafe 1464, define
 * K20_USE_UNSAFE_FLL_FACTOR_ON_INTERNAL_OSCILLATOR. The nominal target
 * frequency is calculated as follows:
 * 32.768 kHz * 1464 = 47.972352 Mhz
 *
 * If you want to be on the safe side make sure this option is not defined to
 * have a safer factor of 1280 which would lead to a nominal target frequency
 * of:
 * 32.768 kHz * 1280 = 41.94304 Mhz
 *
